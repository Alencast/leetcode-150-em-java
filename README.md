# LeetCode Top 150 in Java 🇧🇷➡️🌍

This repository contains my Java solutions for the "Top 150 LeetCode Questions" commonly asked in technical interviews at major tech companies.

## 📌 About

The goal of this project is to master data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques by solving curated problems that appear frequently in coding interviews.

I'm solving the problems by topic (e.g. Arrays, Strings, HashMaps...), starting with easy ones, then progressing to medium and hard levels — all implemented in **Java** with clean code and comments.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve my problem-solving skills in Java.
- Prepare for technical interviews (remote or abroad).
- Build a strong portfolio with well-structured code.
- Get comfortable with real interview-style challenges.

## 🛠️ Tools & Practices

- Java 17
- Clean code & meaningful variable names
- No built-in shortcuts
- Time and space complexity analysis
- GitHub for version control and public progress

## 🚀 Progress
